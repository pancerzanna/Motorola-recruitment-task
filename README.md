Why do I code? I think a better question would be: Why do I want to learn how to code?
I would like to gain and expand my knowledge in a new field. I am focused on continuous development and I would like to develop my abstract thinking ability. Thatâ€™s why I am ready for the new challenge of learning how to code.
